# Adamsy Radios
 <br />
Adamsy Radios is an AI controlled radio app in which the user can command the app with the voice, for example: 'PLAY SOME MUSIC' will play the radio and asking to stop the music will do it too, just a simple 'HEY ALAN' would wake up the voice assistant.
I have used ALan to bring the voice controlled AI features inside the application, audioplayers plugin to play the radios and VelocityX for the seamless UI
